What should the teacher say?
A. Any other ideas?
 B. Time’s up.
 C. Let’s check the answers together.
Explanation:

 B. Who would like to answer?
 C. Time’s up.

C is used when stopping a timed activity, but students have already finished.

3. After asking a comprehension question about the reading text, the teacher gives students thirty seconds to think. Several students look thoughtful, but no hands are raised yet. The teacher wants to encourage voluntary participation rather than selecting someone directly.

A. Can anyone help her?

GROUP 6
1. The teacher is explaining the instructions for a new group project. At first, students seem attentive, but gradually small conversations start at the back of the classroom. Within seconds, more students begin whispering, and the teacher’s voice is no longer clearly heard. The teacher pauses, looks around the room, and waits briefly.What should the teacher say?
A. Work in pairs, please.
B. Everyone, please quiet down.
C. Any ideas? Just say what you think.

Explanation: The main issue here is increasing noise that interferes with instruction. The teacher needs to regain control before continuing. This utterance directly addresses the behavior and re-establishes order.
A is a thoughtful option, because it relates to group organization. However, the current problem is not task structure but classroom noise. Pair work would likely increase talking instead of reducing it.
C shows encouragement and lowers pressure, which is very positive in participation contexts. However, students are not silent due to anxiety; they are talking over instructions. Therefore, this response does not solve the immediate issue.
2. The teacher has just written important exam instructions on the board. Some students are copying them down, but a few others are still chatting, checking their phones under the desk, or looking out the window. The teacher knows this information is essential and does not want anyone to miss it.
What should the teacher say?
A. I need your full attention now.
 B. Are you ready?
 C. Change roles, please.
Explanation:
 The teacher needs to signal urgency and importance. This sentence clearly communicates that students must stop distractions and focus immediately.
B is a positive and interactive choice, but it merely checks readiness. It does not directly address the distraction or emphasize the importance of the information.
C is appropriate in speaking or role-play activities, but in this case, students are not changing roles; they are being inattentive.
3. During a whole-class discussion, several students become excited and start speaking at the same time. One student raises her hand but is interrupted by two others who call out their answers without waiting. The classroom becomes noisy, and it is difficult to follow any single response. The teacher raises one hand slightly and looks around the room.
What should the teacher say?
A. One voice at a time, please.
 B. Any ideas? Just say what you think.
 C. Work in pairs, please.
Explanation:
 The issue here is overlapping speech. The teacher needs to restore order and ensure that each student is heard clearly. This phrase directly manages turn-taking in discussion.
B is encouraging and reduces pressure, which is excellent when students are hesitant. However, the problem here is not silence, but too many students speaking at once.
C is useful for structured collaboration, but this moment requires whole-class control, not pair reorganization.
4. The teacher asks a comprehension question about the reading passage. The classroom becomes completely silent. Several students look down at their desks, avoid eye contact, or pretend to write something. The teacher waits for a few seconds, but no one raises a hand.
What should the teacher say?
A. If no one raises your hand, I’ll randomly call someone.
 B. Let’s be respectful.
 C. Back to your seats.
Explanation:
 Students are avoiding volunteering. This statement encourages participation while subtly increasing accountability. It often motivates students to raise their hands voluntarily.
B promotes a positive classroom climate, which is important. However, there is no disrespect happening in this situation.
C is appropriate after movement activities, but students are already seated.
5. During an individual writing task, the classroom is supposed to be quiet. The teacher notices two students whispering and occasionally glancing at each other’s notebooks. Other students nearby begin to lose focus because of the distraction. The teacher walks slowly toward their desks and pauses beside them.
What should the teacher say?
A. Are you talking about the lesson?
 B. Any ideas? Just say what you think.
 C. Change roles, please.
Explanation:
 This question indirectly checks whether the conversation is task-related. It allows students to correct their behavior without immediate confrontation.
B is supportive and participation-oriented, but this is not a brainstorming moment.
C applies to role-play or pair speaking, which is not happening here.
6. The teacher asks an open-ended speaking question about the topic. After a few seconds of silence, one student slowly raises their hand but looks a bit nervous. The student begins answering but hesitates several times and finally stops mid-sentence, saying softly, “I’m not sure if this is right,” while avoiding eye contact. The rest of the class remains quiet, waiting for the teacher’s response.
What should the teacher say?
A. It’s okay to make mistakes.
 B. I’m waiting for silence.
 C. Back to your seats.
Explanation:
By saying “It’s okay to make mistakes,” the teacher normalizes errors as part of learning and reduces performance pressure. This reassurance encourages the student to continue speaking and helps maintain a psychologically safe classroom environment.
B is effective for general noise control, but this situation requires emotional support, not silence management.
C is suitable after physical movement, which is not occurring here.
7. Several students finish a writing task early and begin whispering and tapping their pens on the desks. Other students are still writing and appear distracted. The teacher notices the noise level slowly increasing.
What should the teacher say?
A. If you’ve finished, check your answers again or help your partner quietly.
 B. Let’s settle down.
 C. Eyes on me, please.
Explanation:
 This response keeps early finishers engaged without interrupting those still working. It maintains productivity and classroom calm.
B is helpful when the entire class is noisy, but here only a small group needs redirection.
C shifts attention to the teacher, which is unnecessary since students are meant to be working independently.
8. The teacher asks a student to explain why the main character in the story feels disappointed. The student replies briefly, and then stops speaking. The teacher knows from previous lessons that this student usually gives thoughtful answers and is capable of deeper analysis. The rest of the class is waiting, and there is a clear opportunity to expand the response.
What should the teacher say?
A. Come on, I know you can do better.
 B. I’m waiting for silence.
 C. Work in pairs, please.
Explanation:
 The student has answered, but the response is incomplete. The teacher’s goal is not discipline or task reorganization but cognitive expansion. This statement expresses confidence in the student’s ability and encourages elaboration without providing the answer.
B is a strong classroom management phrase, and it works well when students are noisy. However, in this situation, the class is already quiet and attentive.
C is a useful instructional strategy, especially for collaborative discussion. Nevertheless, the teacher wants this specific student to develop their individual answer, not shift to pair work.
9. The bell rings after break time, but several students are still outside the classroom talking. Inside, a few students are sitting in different seats than usual and have not taken out their materials. The noise level remains high, and the lesson cannot begin effectively under these conditions.
What should the teacher say?
A. Take your seats. I need everyone ready in ten seconds.
 B. It’s okay to make mistakes.
 C. Work in pairs, please.
Explanation:
 This situation requires firm and time-bound classroom control. The instruction is clear, direct, and sets an immediate behavioral expectation.
B provides emotional reassurance, which is valuable in speaking contexts, but this is a discipline issue.
